(RESET)

The term reset stands for undoing changes. The git reset command is used to reset the changes. The git reset command has three core forms of invocation. These forms are as follows.

Soft
Mixed
Hard

It acts as a time machine for Git.
Git Reset Head (Git Reset Soft):The soft option does not touch the index file or working tree at all, but it resets the Head as all options do. When the soft mode runs, the refs pointers updated, and the resets stop there. It will act as git amend command. It is not an authoritative command. Sometimes developers considered it as a waste of time.


Git Reset mixed:A mixed option is a default option of the git reset command. If we would not pass any argument, then the git reset command considered as --mixed as default option. A mixed option updates the ref pointers. The staging area also reset to the state of a specified commit. The undone changes transferred to the working directory.

Command for Git Reset Mixed is :

                             $ git reset or  $ git reset --mixed

Git Reset Hard :It will first move the Head and update the index with the contents of the commits. It is the most direct, unsafe, and frequently used option. The --hard option changes the Commit History, and ref pointers are updated to the specified commit. Then, the Staging Index and Working Directory need to reset to match that of the specified commit. Any previously pending commits to the Staging Index and the Working Directory gets reset to match Commit Tree. It means any awaiting work will be lost.

Command for Git Reset Hard is:
 $ git reset --hard
